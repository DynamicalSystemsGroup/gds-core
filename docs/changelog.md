# Changelog

All notable changes to the GDS ecosystem are documented here. Each release
lists affected packages, breaking changes, and new capabilities.

## 2026-10-03 — Symbolic expression security fix

### gds-domains v0.1.1

Fix arbitrary Python execution from untrusted symbolic expression strings in
ODE compilation, state/output linearization, and Hamiltonian dynamics and
Lagrangian parsing. Expressions are now constructed directly from validated
syntax, with checked symbol names and dummy arguments for code generation.

**Compatibility:** only the [documented mathematical grammar](symbolic/index.md#expression-grammar-and-security)
is accepted. Unknown symbols, arbitrary Python/SymPy constructors, unsupported
syntax, and invalid symbol names raise `SymbolicError` when consumed. Existing
models using supported arithmetic and math functions continue to work.

Expression length, syntax node count, depth, and integer literal size are bounded;
these limits do not bound subsequent symbolic computations.

### gds-symbolic v0.99.1

Require `gds-domains[symbolic]>=0.1.1` so upgrading this compatibility package
requires the fixed implementation. The package remains deprecated in favor of
`gds_domains.symbolic`.

Users of affected versions should upgrade with
`python -m pip install --upgrade "gds-domains[symbolic]>=0.1.1"` or
`python -m pip install --upgrade "gds-symbolic>=0.99.1"`.

## 2026-04-07 — gds-proof Layer 1 Integration

Promotes gds-proof from standalone (Layer 0, protocol-only) to Layer 1
(depends on `gds-framework`, integrates with verification pipeline).

### gds-proof v0.2.0

**Breaking:** `ProofableBlock` -> `SymbolicBlock`, `ProofableModel` -> `SymbolicModel`.
`analyze_reachability()` -> `analyze_inductive_safety()`. Deprecated aliases until v1.0.0.

New:

- **`GDSSymbolicBlock` / `GDSSymbolicModel`** -- adapters bridging GDS types to proof engine
- **`findings.py`** -- converts proof results to `Finding`/`VerificationReport` (check ID: `PROOF-001`)
- **`derive_state_symbols()`** / **`derive_assumption_context()`** -- GDS type utilities
- Documentation: `docs/proof/` with overview and getting-started guide

### gds-proof v0.1.0

New package (PR #193). Deterministic model identity and SymPy-based invariant
proof verification. 5-strategy implication prover, 3-layer inductive safety,
multi-lemma ProofScript system. 112 tests, 95% coverage.

## 2026-04-03 — Tier 0 + Tier 1 Complete

Driven by external reviews from Zargham and Jamsheed (Shorish) against the
GDS paper (Zargham & Shorish 2022). The reviews identified foundational gaps
in notation alignment, formal property statements, ControlAction semantics,
temporal agnosticism documentation, and execution contract formalization.
This release closes all Tier 0 and Tier 1 roadmap items.

### gds-framework v0.3.0

**Breaking:** `CanonicalGDS.input_ports` now contains only controlled inputs (U_c);
disturbance-tagged BoundaryAction ports are in the new `disturbance_ports` field.

New capabilities:

- **ExecutionContract** — DSL-layer time model declaration (`discrete`, `continuous`,
  `event`, `atemporal`) with Moore/Mealy ordering. Attached as optional field on
  GDSSpec. A spec without a contract remains valid for structural verification.
- **ControlAction canonical projection** — `CanonicalGDS` now extracts output ports
  (Y) and renders the output map `y = C(x, d)` in the formula.
- **Disturbance input partition** — `disturbance_ports` on `CanonicalGDS` separates
  policy-bypassing exogenous inputs (W) from controlled inputs (U_c) via
  `tags={"role": "disturbance"}` on BoundaryAction.
- **TypeDef.constraint_kind** — optional named constraint pattern (`non_negative`,
  `positive`, `probability`, `bounded`, `enum`) enabling round-trip export via SHACL.

New verification checks:

- **SC-010** — ControlAction outputs must not feed the g pathway (Policy/BoundaryAction)
- **SC-011** — ExecutionContract well-formedness
- **DST-001** — Disturbance-tagged BoundaryAction must not wire to Policy

Documentation:

- Formal property statements for all 15 core checks (G-001..G-006, SC-001..SC-009)
- Requirement traceability markers on all verification tests
- Tests for SC-005..SC-009 (previously untested)
- Controller-plant duality design document
- Temporal agnosticism invariant with three-layer stack diagram
- Audit of 30+ docs replacing "timestep" with temporally neutral vocabulary
- Assurance claims document with verification passport template
- Execution semantics design document with DSL contract mapping
- Disturbance formalization design document
- Notation harmonized with Zargham & Shorish (2022)

### gds-owl v0.2.0

- **SHACL constraint promotion** — `TypeDef.constraint_kind` metadata exports as SHACL
  property shapes (`sh:minInclusive`, `sh:maxInclusive`, `sh:minExclusive`, `sh:in`).
  Constraints with a `constraint_kind` are now R2 round-trippable; those without remain
  R3 lossy. Import reconstructs Python callable constraints from SHACL metadata.
- New ontology properties: `constraintKind`, `constraintLow`, `constraintHigh`, `constraintValue`
- New `build_constraint_shapes()` public API

### gds-psuu v0.2.1

- **Parameter schema validation** — `ParameterSpace.from_parameter_schema()` creates
  sweep dimensions from declared ParameterDef entries. `validate_against_schema()`
  catches missing params, type mismatches, and out-of-bounds sweeps.
- **PSUU-001 check** following the GDS Finding pattern
- Sweep runner validates against schema when `parameter_schema` is provided

### gds-stockflow v0.1.1

- Emit `ExecutionContract(time_domain="discrete")` from `compile_model()`

### gds-control v0.1.1

- Emit `ExecutionContract(time_domain="discrete")` from `compile_model()`

### gds-games v0.3.2

- Emit `ExecutionContract(time_domain="atemporal")` from `compile_pattern_to_spec()`

### gds-software v0.1.1

- Emit `ExecutionContract` from all 6 compilers: `atemporal` for DFD, C4, component,
  ERD, dependency; `discrete` for state machines

### gds-business v0.1.1

- Emit `ExecutionContract` from all 3 compilers: `discrete` for CLD and supply chain,
  `atemporal` for value stream maps

### gds-analysis v0.1.1

- Guard `gds-continuous` import in `backward_reachability.py` (previously caused
  ImportError when gds-continuous wasn't installed)
